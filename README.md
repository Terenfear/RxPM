# RxPM
Reactive implementation of [Presentation Model](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/PresentationModel.html) pattern in Android.

## Why Use RxPM?
Ever found yourself thinking about passing the RxJava chain from the View to the Presenter in MVP?
Don’t satisfied with Databinding Library in MVVM?
Then you are one of us, who think this patterns are not Rx-friendly.

<img src="/docs/images/rxpm_vs_mvp_vs_mvvm.png" width="400">

RxPM allows to use the RxJava all the way from a widget to the data. And the main advantage of that is the possibility to declaratively define and interconnect reactive states.

## Dependency

Add the dependency to your build.gradle:
```gradle
dependencies {

    compile 'me.dmdev.rxpm:rxpm:1.1.3'
    
    // optional RxBinding
    compile 'com.jakewharton.rxbinding2:rxbinding-kotlin:$latest_version'
    
    // if you use Conductor
    compile 'com.bluelinelabs:conductor:$latest_version'
}
```
## Usage
### Create a Presentation Model class and define reactive properties
```kotlin
class DataPresentationModel(
        private val dataModel: DataModel
) : PresentationModel() {

    val data = State<List<Item>>(emptyList())
    val inProgress = State(false)
    val errorMessage = Command<String>()
    val refreshAction = Action<Unit>()

    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()

        refreshAction.observable
                .skipWhileInProgress(inProgress.observable)
                .flatMapSingle {
                    dataModel.loadData()
                            .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())
                            .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())
                            .bindProgress(inProgress.consumer)
                            .doOnError { 
                                errorMessage.consumer.accept("Loading data error")
                            }
                }
                .retry()
                .subscribe(data.consumer)
                .untilDestroy()

        refreshAction.consumer.accept(Unit) // first loading on create
    }
}
```
### Bind to the PresentationModel properties
```kotlin
class DataFragment : PmSupportFragment<DataPresentationModel>() {

    override fun providePresentationModel() = DataPresentationModel(DataModel())

    override fun onBindPresentationModel(pm: DataPresentationModel) {

        pm.inProgress.observable.bindTo(swipeRefreshLayout.refreshing())

        pm.data.observable.bindTo {
            // adapter.setItems(it)
        }

        pm.errorMessage.observable.bindTo {
            // show alert dialog
        }

        swipeRefreshLayout.refreshes().bindTo(pm.refreshAction.consumer)
    }
}
```

## Main Components
### State
**State** is a reactive property which represents a View state. It holds the latest value and emits it on binding. For example, **State** can be used to represent a progress of the http-request or some data that can change in time.

In the PresentationModel:
```kotlin
val inProgress = State<Boolean>(false)
```
Change the value through the consumer:
```kotlin
inProgress.consumer.accept(true)
```
Observe changes in the View:
```kotlin
pm.inProgress.observable.bindTo(progressBar.visibility())
```

### Action
**Action** is the reactive property which represents the user actions. It's mostly used for receiving events from the View, such as clicks.

In the View:
```kotlin
button.clicks().bindTo(pm.buttonClicks.consumer)
```

In the PresentationModel:
```kotlin
val buttonClicks = Action<Unit>()

buttonClicks.observable
    .subscribe {
        // handle click
    }
    .untilDestroy()
```

### Command
**Command** is the reactive property which represents a command to the View. It can be used to show a toast or alert dialog.

Define it in the PresentationModel:
```kotlin
val errorMessage = Command<String>()
```
Show some message in the View:
```kotlin
pm.errorMessage.observable.bindTo { message ->
    Toast.makeText(context, message, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
}
```

When the View is unbound from the PresentationModel, **Command** collects all received values and emits them on binding:

![Command](/docs/images/bwu.png)

### PresentationModel
The PresentationModel stores the state of the View and holds the UI logic. 
PresentationModel instance is automatically retained during configuration changes. This behavior is provided by the delegate which controls the lifecycle.

Lifecycle callbacks:
- `onCreate()` — Called when the PresentationModel is created. Initialize your Rx chains in this method.
- `onBind()` — Called when the View binds to the PresentationModel.
- `onUnbind()` — Called when the View unbinds from the PresentationModel.
- `onDestroy()` — Called when the PresentationModel is being destroyed. Dispose all subscriptions in this method.

What's more you can observe lifecycle changes via `lifecycleObservable`.

Also the useful extensions of the *Disposable* are available to make lifecycle handling easier: `untilUnbind` and `untilDestroy`. 

### PmView
The library has several predefined classes which implement `AndroidPmView`: `PmSupportActivity`, `PmSupportFragment` and `PmController` (for [Conductor](https://github.com/bluelinelabs/Conductor/)'s users). 

You have to implement two methods:
1) `providePresentationModel()` — Create the instance of the PresentationModel.
2) `onBindPresentationModel()` — Bind to the PresentationModel properties in this method. Use the `bindTo` extension and [RxBinding](https://github.com/JakeWharton/RxBinding) for this. 

Also the library has a predefined classes for work with Google Maps.

### Two-way Data Binding
For the cases of two-way data binding (eg. input field text changes) the library has predefined [Сontrols](https://github.com/dmdevgo/RxPM/tree/develop/rxpm/src/main/kotlin/me/dmdev/rxpm/widget).

In the PresentationModel:
```kotlin
val name = inputControl(
    formatter = {
        it.take(50).capitalize().replace("[^a-zA-Z- ]".toRegex(), "")
    }
)

val checked = checkControl()
```

In the View:
```kotlin
pm.name bindTo editText
pm.checked bindTo checkBox
```
